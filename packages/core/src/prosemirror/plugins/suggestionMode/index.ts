/**
 * Suggestion Mode Plugin
 *
 * When active, intercepts all text insertions and deletions, wrapping
 * them in tracked-change marks (insertion/deletion) instead of modifying
 * the document directly.
 *
 * - Typed text is marked as insertion (green underline)
 * - Deleted text is NOT removed — it's marked as deletion (red strikethrough)
 * - Text already marked as insertion by the current author is deleted
 *   normally (retracting your own suggestion)
 *
 * The implementation is split across this directory for readability:
 *   - `state.ts`       — plugin key, meta constants, shared types
 *   - `markAttrs.ts`   — fresh-attr minting + projection
 *   - `adjacency.ts`   — coalescing lookups (sibling, cross-block, cellMarker)
 *   - `handlers/`      — keyboard / input handlers (delete, insert, structural)
 *   - `commands.ts`    — toggle / set / isActive
 *   - this file        — `createSuggestionModePlugin` + public re-exports

/**
 * Create the suggestion-mode ProseMirror plugin. **Must be mounted on
 * the editor view for `setSuggestionMode` and `toggleSuggestionMode`
 * to do anything** — the React adapter (`@eigenpal/docx-editor-react`)
 * auto-mounts this inside the `DocxEditor` component, so consumers using
 * the bundled component don't need to register it themselves.
 *
 * When active, typed text gets the `insertion` mark, deleted text gets
 * the `deletion` mark (text stays in the doc; the painter strikes it
 * through), Enter sets `pPrIns` on the originating paragraph, and
 * Backspace at paragraph start sets `pPrDel` on the previous paragraph.
 * Author + adjacent same-author marks coalesce into one tracked change.
 *
 * @param initialActive - Whether suggesting mode starts on. Default `false`.
 * @param author - Author name attached to every minted revision. Default `'User'`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createSuggestionModePlugin } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-core/prosemirror/plugins';
 *
 * const plugin = createSuggestionModePlugin(false, 'Jane');
 * EditorState.create({ doc, plugins: [plugin, ...other] });
